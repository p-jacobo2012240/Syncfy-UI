## About the Syncfy-UI

Syncfy was born as a tracking measure for a large volume of documents. Normally we have ftp servers that upload the files from the initial origin to the cloud, but syncfy provides a set of tools for file tracking, scalability infrastructure, observers for configured alerts and different channels to manage files in AWS S3 and spaces in Digital Ocean in one place.

## Motivations

- Cloud Native infrastructure
- CQRS pattern for handling of events
- Administration in one place by start to end
- Extensive features of legacy ftp system files
